                    <p>Automated tools require manual configuration and human supervision to effectively execute campaigns. ... AI refers to how computer systems can use huge amounts of data to imitate human intelligence and reasoning, allowing the system to learn, predict and recommend what to do next. 
                      Artificial intelligence can be a form of automation, as can robotics and software three fields that the automation report focused on. ... In the more recent AI-specific report, the authors focused of the subset of AI known as machine learning, or using algorithms to find patterns in large quantities of data. Labor automation is the practice of substituting technology for human labor to perform specific tasks or jobs. ... The term today generally applies to cases in which the technology being deployed replaces knowledge-based tasks or positions, rather than merely replacing manual processes. 
                      Things such as electronic devices, machines, and even robots are used to automate tasks that used to be completed by humans. Advances in software, machine learning, and robotics are quickly making it possible for companies to accomplish more with fewer workers.

                    <p>Data Scientists and Analysts use data analytics techniques in their research, and businesses also use it to inform their decisions. Data analysis can help companies better understand their customers, evaluate their ad campaigns, personalize content, create content strategies and develop products. As I mentioned above, data analytics is not a difficult field to break into because it isn't highly academic, and you can learn the skills required along the way. However, there is a wide variety of skills you will need to master in order to do the job of a data analyst. If you plan to switch being a data analyst but bear no experience in the industry, you can probably start with a degree in an online course in data analysts. The course would make your foundation strong in the subject, also allowing you to build practical projects and learn and develop your skills. Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making</p>

A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. cybersecurity or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.The field is becoming increasingly significant due to the increased reliance on computer systems, the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the "Internet of things". Owing to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world</p>
